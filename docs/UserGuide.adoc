== Introduction
Are you having trouble keeping track of important dates and events? Is there too much hassle
in the current way you manage contacts? If these are problems that plague your everyday life, stress no further, for we've
engineered a cure!

DoC is here to remedy all your event tracking and contact management woes. Built as a Command Line Interface (CLI) application,
DoC provides a speedy solution to manage event and contact information, with only just a few clicks on the keyboard.

== Getting Started

.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
